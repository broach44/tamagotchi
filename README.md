# Tamagotchi

## Description
This application takes the user back to the 90's when the little digital pet was a hit.  This application features your very own Tamagotchi.  With this application you can interact with the digital pet by feeding it, playing with it, allowing it to fight or run away, and letting it rest.  There are two buttons for each of the components that the user can click to interact.  Each button will interact with the pet differently.  The buttons will either add or subtract from the component score.

The pet also features a progress bar that automatically averages the scores from the 4 different components.  If this progress bar reaches zero, the pet dies! Oh no, not to worry! You will be presented with the option to revive the pet.

## Features

- Uses ES6 Modules to keep the various components separate
- Sass nesting rules and nested selectors used in stylesheets
- Custom pixel animation
